# ChatApp

This project represents a significant step in my programming journey because I learned important things while developing it. I spent some time on it, but for now, it is abandoned because I didn't plan it well from the beginning, making it harder to scale.

## Why I created it?

At first, it was just a game, but over time, the project started to grow and take shape. I simply wanted to learn and improve myself.

## About the project

The project is a chat application that allows users to create accounts, send/accept/decline friend requests, create individual chats and groups, modify profile and group information such as name and image, send messages, and see connected/disconnected friends or group members.

### Socket.io

The project uses sockets to establish a real-time connection between users so that they receive messages, requests, and information about friends at the same moment as the action is performed.

## Future changes

In the future, the project will have the option to make video and audio calls, as well as send files and images.
